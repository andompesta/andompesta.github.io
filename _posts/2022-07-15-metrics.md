Reccomandation systems are one of the most well known application for machine learning as it is usually modelled as a binary classification task, where the positive class ($y^+$) represents clicks or conversions, and the negative class ($y^-$) represents examples without interaction.
In the most common case binary classifiers are implemented as single output logistic regressors.
As such they do not directly provide a class lable, but rather the predicted probability of the postive class $$\rmP( y = y^+)$$. 
The final label is defined comparing the predicted probability to a threshold $t$ such that:

$$
\hat{y} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if} ~ \rmP( y = y^+) \geq t \\
0 & \text{o.w.}
\end{cases}
$$

Common sense suggests that a reasonable threshold could be $t=0.5$. 
However, this is hardly the case in the real-world as datasets are hardly perfectly ballanced and models are not always perfectly calibrated.
To overcome this problem we need metrics able to capture the model performance indipendently of the threshold.
